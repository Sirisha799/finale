A food waste tracker is a digital or manual system designed to measure, monitor, and reduce the amount of food waste generated in settings like restaurants, homes, or businesses. By collecting data on what is being wasted, where, and why, these tools provide actionable insights that help users identify problem areas and develop strategies to minimize waste. Modern food waste trackers often integrate smart scales, sensors, and user-friendly interfaces, allowing for real-time and accurate data recording and analysis; some solutions also estimate the economic loss and carbon footprint of wasted food. Overall, using a food waste tracker encourages improved food management, cost savings, and environmental sustainability by making waste reduction efforts more visible and actionable.
